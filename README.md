# Astra-ColorTK

[Astra Productions Color Toolkit](https://astraproductions.com/project/colortoolkit/) for [Pixera](https://pixera.one/)

_ColorTK is a toolset that provides industry standard color grading and adjustment tools for users of the Pixera media server platform._

## Quick Start

**Looking for the Pixera Shader pack and control app?**

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/flowb/Astra-ColorTK/releases) to download the latest version ---->

## Introduction

For a quick overview of the goals of the project please visit this site:
https://astraproductions.com/project/colortoolkit/

ColorTK has two principal components:

1. The **Shader** pack: a set of GLSL effects that are formatted for use in Pixera
2. **ColorTK Control App**: a control interface that communicates with Shader instances running in Pixera

## Getting Started

If you are looking to get started with ColorTK, the best way is to go to the releases tab, download the current version and follow the installation instructions.

If you run into any problems please create an **Issue** using the Issues tab at the top of this page.

## Installation

The 'Astra-ColorTK' folder should be copied into the Pixera shaders directory. On my system that is:

```
C:\Program Files\AV Stumpfl\Pixera\build_2-0-20\data\effects\current
```

Launch the control application for your given platform.
_Binaries are currently unsigned so Windows and MacOs will want you to confirm that the app is safe_

## Demo Videos

_These installation and useage demo videos were produced with the TouchDesigner based controller. The binary applications do not require TouchDesigner._
